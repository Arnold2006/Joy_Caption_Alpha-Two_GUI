ðŸŽ¨ Joy Caption Batch GUI
Joy_Caption_Batchâ€‘GUI is a convenient graphical frontend built on top of the JoyCaption batch processing tool, ideal for users who want to generate captions for large sets of images using a Visual Language Model (VLM) without grappling with command-line scripts.

Key Features:
Batch Image Captioning: Select an entire folder (or multiple folders) of images and caption them in one goâ€”no need to run separate commands for each file.
Interactive GUI: Powered by a Gradio-style interface, it offers an intuitive way to load images, view captions, and configure settings.
JoyCaption Model Support: Integrates with JoyCaption (Alpha, Preâ€‘alpha, or newer versions), offering you a free, open, and uncensored captioning engine trained for diverse image styles 
Lowâ€‘VRAM Mode: Automatically adapts to your GPU setup, supporting quantized 4â€‘bit variants for environments with limited VRAM (e.g., 8â€“12â€¯GB) 

Benefits:
Speed & Scalability: Captions dozens or even hundreds of images with a single clickâ€”details from typical batch performance:
Alphaâ€‘2 on an RTXâ€¯3090: ~6â€“8 images at once, processing ~21 images in under 50 seconds 
Flexible Configuration: Choose caption length, tone, file output settings, recursion through directories, and more.
Openâ€‘Source MIT License: Fully transparent and community-drivenâ€”no gated APIs or usage restrictions
